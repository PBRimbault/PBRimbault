### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

> Curiosity is the key

ðŸŽ‡ I'm a structural engineer and designer who writes code. My background is in traditional project engineering (concept, design, tender, build) with a splash of programming, mathematics and architecture nerdiness thrown i nfor good measure.

ðŸ”­ Always looking for interesting projects to work on! 
I have extensive knowledge in [Rhino + Grasshopper and RhinoCommon](https://github.com/PBRimbault/rhino.inside), linking in with [Oasys GSA](https://github.com/PBRimbault/GSA-Grasshopper), as well in Revit + Dynamo and the trusty workhorse of the AEC world, AutoCAD.
